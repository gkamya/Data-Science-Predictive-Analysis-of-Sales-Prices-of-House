Data Collection and Preprocessing:
	The given data contains a training dataset and a testing dataset separately where data_train has 1168 rows and 81 columns and the data_test has 292 rows and 81 columns.
	This dataset is a Regression data.
	Missing values have been checked by using a user-defined function and it is found that no single row contains any null value. 

Outliers have been checked for and data has been standardized using StandardScaler. 
Multivariate analysis has been performed and pairplots have been created. 

Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning and Model evaluation were the next important steps that followed.
